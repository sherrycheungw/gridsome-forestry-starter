Complete renovation is a full service that includes space planning, mood board, FF&E, and/or home styling. Our experienced team manages the entire construction from start to finish, ensuring a seamless and stress-free project for you that meets your budget. 

After nailing down the schematic design (ie. space planning, design concept), the renovation process begins. We first focus on the construction elements - materials from wall tiles, flooring to plumbing and lighting. We dive into furnishings - from furnitures pieces, cabinet hardware to curtains and rugs.
